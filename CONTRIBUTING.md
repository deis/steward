# Contributing Guidelines

The Deis Steward project accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines the process to help get your contribution accepted.

## How to Contribute A Patch

1. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
1. Submit a pull request (PR).

Patches should adhere to our coding conventions which can be found at [CONVENTIONS.md](./doc/CONVENTIONS.md).

## Merge Approval

Steward collaborators may add the "LGTM" (Looks Good To Me) label to a PR to indicate that it is acceptable for merge. Pull requests may only be merged after the following criteria are met:

1. A core contributor or collaborator has labelled the PR with "LGTM"
1. No GitHub [pull request reviews](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/) are pending unresolved

If a PR is from a Steward collaborator, he or she should be the one to merge and close it. All PRs should be merged using GitHub's "squash and merge" feature. These requirements keep the commit stream clean and give the collaborator the benefit of revisiting the PR before deciding whether to merge the changes.

## Support Channels

Whether you are a user or contributor we our main official support channel is via GitHub issues: https://github.com/deis/steward/issues.

If you find an issue, request a new feature, or have a question, please [open an issue](https://github.com/deis/steward/issues/new).

Before opening a new issue or submitting a new PR, it's helpful to search the project - it's likely that another user has already reported the issue you're facing, or it's a known issue that we're already aware of.
